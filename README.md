# 🔒 Secure Messaging App

This is a **Java-based End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) Messaging App** that uses **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** for key exchange and **AES-GCM** encryption for secure communication. The app is built using **Java Swing** for the UI.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** using ECDH for secure key exchange  
✅ **AES-GCM Encryption** for message confidentiality and integrity  
✅ **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** prevents past messages from being decrypted if a key is compromised  
✅ **Swing-based UI** for easy-to-use messaging between five users  
✅ **Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection** using strong cryptographic techniques  
✅ **Random IV for every message** to prevent replay attacks
